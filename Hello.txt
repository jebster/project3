- Creative Talent (0.6)
- Fitness (0.3)
- Studies (0.1)
-wealth(0)
[ based on faculty ]

Attraction Array //at the start of each cycle, list of people that caught the eyes of the NPC will be in this list;
                  //Higher chance of first date acceptance.
- Attracted [  list of people  ]

Faculty Factor

In the begining of the game; 
The Faculty factor would be 0 for all player and NPC attributes. 



For ARTS
For the purpose for preference
x,y,z would be randomised.
- Creative Talent (0.6)
- Fitness (x)
- Studies (y)
-wealth(z)
where x+y+z+0.6 =1.5
the player's attribute would be compared to the preference and the reputation would be added to the overall score 


For Engineering
For the purpose for preference
x,y,z would be randomised.
- Creative Talent (x)

-wealth(w)
where x+y+z+w = 2.5 (Higher overall requirements to be deemed attractive)
the player's attribute would be compared to the preference and the reputation would be added to the overall score

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   AL 1 (abstract lvl 1)  +++++++++++++++++++++++++

First level; ALL the events and interactions are on this level for extraction of data to the other abstract lvls


Events - University Enrolment, Faculty Enrolment,Mid term period, examination period, Dates, Second dates, Getting Laid

Movements of NPCs and the player; NPCs to move randomly with a radius sensor that notices the player once they are within
the radius of the player;

RadiusDetect = x; //where x depicts the grid radius detectable for NPC to notice 


University enrolment affected by weighted studies scores of students in that faculty.- must be shown in this level;


1st Dates: if(within the Attracted [  list of people  ]) = 100% chance to get a date;
         
       else based on difference between the combined attribute points [( APAI - APPlayer) / ( APAI + APPlayer)] * 100%
       
        Satisfaction 1st Date
             - firstDateSatis= preference deviation + FacultyVariable + Reputation;

zero to one;

based on overall weightage of students being within the attracted list and repuation of the students within faculty

Comments by the lecturer 

:what he sees an image; player should not be on an abstrct level, that can be on a debug view;

abstract map only for debugging;

should not have extra information e.g. enrolment on anotherlvl, should be experienced on the first lvl;

not make sense for 1 instance of higher lvl;
